  "description": "The Blue Oyster (Pleurotus columbinus) is a variant of the oyster mushroom with characteristic blue-gray cap color. It grows preferentially on conifer wood and is cultivated year-round. Like other Pleurotus species, it contains pleurotolysin which is destroyed by heating - therefore always cook thoroughly. It has immunostimulating and cholesterol-lowering properties."
