  "description": "The Orange Caterpillar Fungus (Cordyceps militaris) is a parasitic ascomycete that grows on dead insect larvae and pupae. The fruiting body is orange-red to brick-red colored and grows up to 50 mm tall. In Traditional Chinese Medicine it is considered an important medicinal mushroom with immunostimulating and performance-enhancing properties, attributed to the compound cordycepin. In Europe the fungus is extremely rare to find."
