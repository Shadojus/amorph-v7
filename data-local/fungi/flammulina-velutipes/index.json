  "description": "The Enoki (Flammulina velutipes), also known as Velvet Foot or Winter Mushroom, is a popular edible mushroom with a characteristically velvety brown stem. It grows preferentially on hardwood and is one of the few mushrooms that can fruit even in frost. The cultivated Enoki with its long white stems differs greatly from the wild-growing fungus. It is considered a medicinal mushroom with immune-strengthening properties."
