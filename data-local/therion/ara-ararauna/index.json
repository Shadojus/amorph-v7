  "description": "The blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) is a large South American parrot with vibrant blue upperparts and yellow underparts, with a green forehead. Native to tropical forests from Venezuela to Brazil and Bolivia, they form monogamous pairs that mate for life. These intelligent birds can live 30-35 years in the wild and over 60 years in captivity. They possess powerful beaks capable of cracking hard nuts and use their zygodactyl feet for climbing and manipulating food. Blue-and-yellow macaws are highly social, often gathering at clay licks to consume mineral-rich clay that neutralizes toxins in their diet."
