  "description": "The western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the most common honey bee species worldwide, native to Europe, Africa, and western Asia, now found on every continent except Antarctica. Worker bees are 12-15 mm long and live 6 weeks in summer, while queens can live 3-5 years. A single colony contains 20,000-80,000 individuals. They communicate through dance language, with the waggle dance conveying direction and distance to food sources. Honey bees pollinate approximately 80% of flowering plants and are essential for agriculture. They produce honey by enzymatically converting nectar and evaporating its water content in their hives."
