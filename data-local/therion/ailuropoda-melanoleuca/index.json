  "description": "The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear species endemic to central China. Despite being classified as a carnivore, over 99% of its diet consists of bamboo, requiring consumption of 12-38 kg daily due to the low nutritional value. Their distinctive black and white coloration provides camouflage in their rocky, snowy habitat. Once widespread across southern and eastern China, wild populations are now restricted to mountain ranges in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. Conservation efforts have increased populations from approximately 1,114 in the 1980s to over 1,800 wild individuals today."
