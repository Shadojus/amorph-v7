  "description": "The ocean sunfish (Mola mola) is the heaviest bony fish in the world, with specimens reaching 2,300 kg and 3.3 m in length. Native to tropical and temperate waters worldwide, their distinctive flattened body lacks a true tail fin, instead possessing a rudder-like clavus. They feed primarily on jellyfish, consuming massive quantities to sustain their size. Females produce more eggs than any other vertebrate, up to 300 million at a time. Ocean sunfish are often seen basking on their sides at the surface, possibly for thermoregulation or to allow seabirds to remove parasites. They can host over 40 species of parasites."
