  "description": "The common ostrich (Struthio camelus) is a flightless bird native to Africa and the largest living bird species. Males can reach 2.1-2.8 m in height and weigh up to 156 kg. Their powerful legs enable running speeds up to 70 km/h, making them the fastest birds on land. Ostriches have the largest eyes of any land animal (nearly 5 cm diameter), providing excellent vision for predator detection. They lay the largest eggs of any living bird, each weighing about 1.4 kg. Despite their inability to fly, ostriches retain small wings used for courtship displays and balance while running."
