  "description": "The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey native to North America and the national emblem of the United States. Adults are distinguished by their white head and tail contrasting with a dark brown body, with the characteristic plumage developing around 4-5 years of age. These opportunistic feeders primarily consume fish but also take waterfowl and small mammals. Bald eagles build enormous nests that can weigh over 1 tonne after years of use. Once endangered due to DDT pesticide contamination, populations have recovered dramatically following conservation efforts."
