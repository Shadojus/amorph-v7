With a wingspan of 65-86 mm, they display yellow wings with black vein patterns, blue markings, and distinctive tail-like projections on their hindwings. The species includes multiple subspecies adapted to different regions. Caterpillars are initially black with white markings, developing green coloration with black and orange bands as they mature. When threatened, larvae evert a forked, orange osmeterium gland that releases pungent terpenes. Host plants include umbellifers such as fennel, dill, and wild carrot."
