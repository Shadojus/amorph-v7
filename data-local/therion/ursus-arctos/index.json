  "description": "The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America, including subspecies like the grizzly bear and Kodiak bear. They are omnivorous, with diets varying seasonally from berries and roots to salmon and carrion. Brown bears are solitary except during breeding season or when congregating at food sources like salmon runs. They hibernate for 5-8 months in colder climates, during which females give birth. Adult males can weigh 180-680 kg depending on subspecies and location, with Kodiak bears being the largest."
