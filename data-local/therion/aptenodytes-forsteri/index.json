  "description": "The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species, endemic to Antarctica. Standing up to 120 cm tall and weighing 22-45 kg, they are uniquely adapted to survive the harshest conditions on Earth. Emperor penguins breed during the Antarctic winter, with males incubating eggs on their feet under a brood pouch for about 65 days in temperatures reaching -60C and winds up to 200 km/h. They can dive to depths exceeding 500 meters and hold their breath for over 20 minutes while hunting fish and squid."
