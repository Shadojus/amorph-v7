  "description": "The spotted seahorse (Hippocampus kuda), also known as the yellow seahorse, is a marine fish native to the Indo-Pacific region. Adults reach 17-30 cm in height. Unlike most fish, seahorses swim upright using their dorsal fin and possess a prehensile tail for grasping seagrass and coral. They lack scales and stomachs, requiring almost constant feeding on small crustaceans. Males carry eggs in a specialized brood pouch, giving birth to fully formed miniature seahorses after 2-4 weeks gestation. They form monogamous pair bonds and perform daily greeting dances with their partners. Their populations are threatened by traditional medicine trade and habitat loss."
