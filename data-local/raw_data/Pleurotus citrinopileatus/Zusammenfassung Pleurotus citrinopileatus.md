| Kingdom: | Fungi |

| Division: | Basidiomycota |
| Class: | Agaricomycetes |

| Genus: | Pleurotus |
| Species: | P.&nbsp;citrinopileatus |
| Ecology | Saprotrophic |
**Identification:**
Smell: Grain spawn smells astringent, acrid, nutty, and sometimes “fishy,” with a scent that, in time, is distinctly recognizable to this species.
| fruits | Fruchtig, angenehm, obstartig. |
| --- | --- |
Taste: mild, cashew
Cap: flat or depressed, Caps golden to bright yellow, 2–5 cm, convex to plane at maturity, often depressed in the center, thin fleshed, with decurrent gills that show through the partially translucent cap flesh.
Hymenium: gills, decurrent
Stipe: bare, Stems white, centrally attached to the caps.
Flesh:
|  | Weiß, dünn, faserig, fleischig. |

Veil:
Spores/microscopic features: Spores pale pinkish buff, 7.5–9.0 × 3.0–3.5 µ. Clamp connections present. Hyphal system dimitic.
Growing Characteristic: Usually growing in large clusters arising from a single, joined base. Clusters are often composed of fifty to one hundred or more mushrooms. As strains of this species senesce, the yellow cap color is lost, becoming beige, and fewer mushrooms are produced in each primordial cluster.
Natural habitat: A saprophyte of Asian hardwoods, especially oaks, elm, beech, and poplars.
Danger of confusion: PLEUROTUS CORNUCOPIAE, PLEUROTUS PULMONARIUS, PLEUROCYBELLA PORRIGENS, PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS
Mycelial Characteristic: ottony, whitish mycelium, often with tufts of dense growth, sometimes with yellowish tones, and occasionally run through with underlying rhizomorphic strands. Primordia are yellow at first, especially from strains kept close to their natural origins. Mycelium dense on grain. Colonization of bulk substrates at first wispy, becoming denser with time. This mushroom casts a much finer mycelial mat at first than, for instance, Pleurotus ostreatus or P. pulmonarius on wheat straw.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: MYA, MYPA, or PDYA.

Substrates: Rye, wheat, sorghum, milo, or millet.
Pasteurized wheat, cottonseed hulls, chopped corncobs, and hardwood sawdusts. Alternative substrates being developed commercially are sugarcane bagasse, paper by-products, banana fronds, and peanut hulls. Every part of the coffee plant can be recycled growing Oyster mushrooms—from the coffee grounds, hulls, stalks, limbs, and leaves!
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Perforated plastic columns, bags, trays, and bottles.
Biological efficiencies: This species is not as prolific as the more commonly cultivated P. ostreatus and P. pulmonarius in the conversion of substrate mass to mushrooms. After the second flush, comparatively few mushrooms form. Biological efficiency rating: 25–75% indoors on wheat straw. Yield efficiencies are higher on cottonseed-amended substrates.
**Consuming:**
Nutritional content of 100g:  
This mushroom is likely to have a similar nutritional profile as P. ostreatus.  
Medicinical Properties:
According to Ying (1987) in Icons of Medicinal Fungi, P. citrinopileatus potentially cures pulmonary emphysema. The supportive references are in Chinese. This mushroom is likely to be similar to P. ostreatus in its cholesterol-reducing properties.
