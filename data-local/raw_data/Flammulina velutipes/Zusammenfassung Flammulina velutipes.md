**Flammulina velutipes**
Enokitake (Japanese for “The Snow Peak Mushroom.” Enokidake is an alternative spelling)  
 Nametake (“Slimy Mushroom”)  
 Yuki-motase (“Snow Mushroom”)  
 The Winter Mushroom  
 The Velvet or Furry Foot Collybia  
 The Golden Mushroom (Thailand), Samtfußrübling, Gemeiner Samtfußrübling, Enoki, Winterrübling, Winterling, COLLYBIA VELUTIPES
The Enoki also belongs to the medicinal mushrooms, but it is less important. It generally strengthens the immune system, is rich in vitamins and should be anticancer, in addition to reducing blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol.

**Identification:**
Smell: Grain spawn musty smelling, not pleasant (mushroom smells good)
Taste: mushroom, sweet
Cap: convex, Cap 1–5 cm in diameter, convex to plane to upturned in age, smooth, viscid when wet, bright to dull yellowish to yellowish brown to orangish brown.
Hymenium: adnexed, Gills white to yellow, attached to the stem.
Stipe: bare, Stem usually short 1–3 inches, yellow to yellowish brown, darkening with age and covered with a dense coat of velvety fine brown hairs near the base.
Flesh: white to light yellow
Veil:
Spores/microscopic features: pores white, 6–8 × 3–4 µ, ellipsoid. Hongo (1988) lists a spore size of Japanese varieties of 5–7.5 × 3–4 µ. Moser (1983) reports spores of European collections measuring 8–9 × 4.5–6 µ. These differences may underscore the wide range of varieties included within this complex. Clamp connections present.
Growing Characteristic: In culture, the morphology of this mushroom is highly mutable, being extremely sensitive to carbon dioxide and light levels. Cultivated specimens usually have long yellowish stems, small white to yellowish caps. When spores mature, the caps darken to brown.
Natural habitat: Primarily on hardwoods, occasionally on conifers, commonly growing in the late fall through early winter. This mushroom can freeze, thaw, and continue to grow. One definition of Enoki in Japanese is “huckleberry,” implying that this mushroom grows on that shrub in Japan.
Danger of confusion: GALERINA MARGINATA, GYMNOPILUS PENETRANS, FLAMMULINA FENNAE, FLAMMULINA ELASTICA, FLAMMULINA ONONIDIS, GYMNOPILUS PENETRANS, GYMNOPILUS PICREUS, PHOLIOTA SPUMOSA, GYMNOPILUS SAPINEUS
Mycelial Characteristic: White, longitudinally linear, becoming finely appressed and tinged light brown to spotted with golden yellow-brown zones with age. The surface roughens, resembling fine sandpaper, and sometimes becomes beaded at the earliest stage of primordia formation. Long-stemmed, small-capped mushrooms commonly form along the inside periphery of the petri dish or during cold storage of culture slants.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: PDYA, MYA, OMA, or DFA.

Cropping Cycle: two to three crops, 10-12 days apart
Substrates: A wide variety of hardwoods (oak, alder, poplar, cottonwood, aspen, willow, birch, beech, etc.), and some softwoods (Douglas fir) although the latter are, in general, less productive. The supplemented [sawdust formula](javascript:void\(0\)) works well for many varieties of Enoki mushrooms. One advantage, however, of growing this mushroom on Douglas fir is that this wood has a natural resistance to green mold, especially Trichoderma. The pH range for fruiting falls between 4 and 5. Enokitake also grows on a wide variety of paper products.
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Most automated Enoki farms utilize polypropylene bottles for ease of handling and speed of harvesting. A cylinder of plastic or paper is formed into a cylinder fitted within the open top of each bottle. (This causes the stems to grow long and facilitates harvesting.) If Enoki are grown in bags, the sidewalls of the bags should extend 6 inches above the plane of the fruiting surface to encourage the desirable elongated stems. The plastic walls are stripped down just prior to harvest.
Biological efficiencies: 150%
**Consuming:**
Nutritional content of 100g:  
Variable, influenced by substrate components. Crude protein 17–31%; fat 1.9–5.8%; fiber 3.7%; ash 7.4%.  
Medicinical Properties: The water-soluble polysaccharide flammulin, is 80–100% effective against Sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich carcinoma according to Ying (1987). An epidemiological study in Japan found a community of Enoki growers near the city of Nagano that had unusually low cancer rates. Frequent Enoki consumption was thought to be the cause. Ikekawa et al. (1968) reported anticancer activity from extracts of this mushroom. Zeng et al. (1990) and Qingtian et al. (1991) have published studies of the anti-tumor properties of this mushroom. The polysaccharide thought to be active is commonly referred to as FVP for “Flammulina velutipes polysaccharide.”
