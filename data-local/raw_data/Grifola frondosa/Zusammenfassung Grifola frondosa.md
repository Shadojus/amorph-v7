**Identification:**
Smell: Richly fungoid and uniquely farinaceous, sometimes sweet. To me, rye grain spawn has a fragrance reminiscent of day-old fried corn tortillas. When mushrooms begin to rot, a strong fish-like odor develops.
Taste: mild
Cap: offset or distinct, A large, fleshy polypore, dark gray brown when young, becoming lighter gray in age. (Some varieties fade to a light yellow at maturity.) Fruitbody is composed of multiple, overlapping caps, 2–10 cm in diameter, arising from branching stems, eccentrically attached, and sharing a common base. Young fruitbodies are adorned with fine gray fibrils.
Hymenium: decurrent, pores, white
Stipe: bare
Flesh: light brown
Veil: none
Spores/microscopic features: white, Spores white, slightly elliptical (egg-shaped), smooth, hyaline, 6–7 × 3.5–5 µ. Hyphal system dimitic, clamp connections present in the generative hyphae, infrequently branching, with skeletal, non-septate hyphae.
Growing Characteristic: **Nur jung essbar, im Alter sehr zäh.**
|  | Er kann überdimensionierte Ausmaße haben. In Ribnitz-Damgarten wurde 2018 ein Klapperschwamm mit einem Gewicht von über 20 kg gefunden. |

Natural habitat: found on stumps or at the base of dead or dying deciduous hardwoods, especially oaks, elms, maples, blackgum, beech, and occasionally on larch. According to Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1986), this mushroom has also been collected on pines (Douglas fir), although rarely so. G. frondosa is a “white rot” fungus. Although it is found at the bases of dying trees, most mycologists view this mushroom as a saprophyte, exploiting tree tissue dying from other causes. **Wurzelbereich von Eichen (QUERCUS) oder Kastanien (CASTANEA), seltener an Linden (TILIA) oder Buchen (FAGUS), parasitär und folgezersetzend, Weißfäuleauslöser, Sommer bis Spätherbst.**
Danger of confusion: POLYPORUS UMBELLATUS, BONDARZEWIA MESENTERICA, SPARASSIS CRISPA, SPARASSIS BREVIPES, MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS, ALBATRELLUS CONFLUENS
Mycelial Characteristic: White, longitudinally linear, eventually thickly cottony on enriched agar media, non-rhizomorphic. The mycelium grows out unevenly, not forming the circular colonies typical of most mushrooms. Regions of the mycelium surge while other regions abate in their rate of growth. This pattern of growth seems characteristic of the species, as I have seen it in the majority of the twenty strains of G. frondosa that I have in my culture library. Often, the mycelium develops light tawny brown tones along the outside peripheral edges in aging. At maturity, the dense mycelial mat can be peeled directly off the agar media. Once on sawdust, many strains have mycelia that develop strong yellowish to orangish brown mottled zones, exuding a yellowish orange metabolite. Sawdust spawn, when young is white. As the spawn matures, rust colors prevail.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: MYA, MYPA, PDYA, or DFA.

Cropping Cycle: 3-4 weeks for max 2 flushes
Substrates: Hardwood sawdust, sawdust/chips/bran, particularly oak, poplar, cottonwood, elm, willow, and alder. Alder and poplar stumps are less likely to support outdoor fruitings, given the hold competitors like Pleurotus ostreatus and allies have on that niche. For indoor cultivation, yields substantially vary between various wood types. Oak is generally preferred, although strains growing on conifers are being developed.
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Polypropylene bags with filter patches for air exchange. Polypropylene bottles and buckets have also been used.
Biological efficiencies: ½ to 1 pound mushrooms per 5–7 pounds of sterilized, enriched hardwood sawdust.
**Consuming:**
Nutritional content of 100g:  
Approximately 27% protein (dry weight). Producing assorted vitamins—Vitamin B1: 1.5 mg%; Vitamin B2: 1.6 mg%; Niacin: 54 mg%; Vitamin C: 63 mg%; and Vitamin D: 410 IU. Saccharide content is nearly 50%. Assorted minerals/metals include magnesium at 67 mg%; iron at 0.5 mg%; calcium at 11.0 mg%; and phosphorus at 425 mg%. Moisture content of fresh specimens are approximately 80%, in contrast to more fleshy mushrooms which average 90% water. Our analysis show beta-glucan levels at 14.5% of dry mass.  
Medicinical Properties:
In vitro studies at the National Cancer Institute of the powdered fruitbodies (sulfated fraction) of Grifola frondosa show significant activity against the HIV (AIDS) virus when tested through its Anti-HIV Drug Testing System under the Developmental Therapeutics Program. The National Institute of Health of Japan announced similar results in January of 1991. (The mycelium is not active.) Maitake extracts compared favorably with AZT but with no negative side effects. This is the first mushroom confirmed to have anti-HIV activity, in vitro, by both Japanese researchers and U.S. scientists. Studies with human subjects are currently ongoing in United States, Sweden, and England.
One of the polysaccharide fractions responsible for the immunostimulatory activity is three-branched ß 1,6 Glucan, known as grifolan. This polysaccharide was first characterized by Ohno et al. (1985), whose team found it in both the mycelium and the mushrooms. Their work showed strong antitumor activity in mice against murine solid tumor, Sarcoma 180 in only 35 days, causing complete tumor regression in one-third to one-half of the trials. Alkali extracts were found to be more effective than cold or hot water infusions. Human prostatic cells grown in vitro were effectively killed (90%+ in combination with carustine) through oxidative stress to the cell wall membrane when exposed to a purified fraction of ß 1,6 glucan (480 µ/ml.). In a similar study with cancer cells grown in vitro, water extracts of Maitake significantly slowed the reproduction of T-4 leukemia and Hela cervical cancer cells (Lovy et al. 1999). The molecular weight of the ß 1,6 polysaccharide constituent approaches nearly 1,000,000, and yet it acts as a cytotoxic agent to cancerous cells, causing apoptosis, in vitro. The mechanism of activity—their target specificities of cancer cells—is still being investigated (Konno et al., 2000; Borchers et al., 1999).
According to Chinese and Japanese reports, water extracts of this mushroom, when given to mice implanted with tumors, inhibited tumor growth by more than 86% (Nanba 1992; Ying et al. (1987). The dosage level was 1.0–10 milligrams of Maitake extract per kilogram of body weight over 10 days. No studies have yet been published ascertaining the extrapolation of this dosage level from a mouse to a human. Dr. Fukumi Morishige suggests that vitamin C be taken with Maitake (as well as with Ganoderma lucidum) as it helps reduce the polysaccharides into smaller, more usable chains of sugars, increasing their bioavailability. A recent analysis of organically-grown Maitake fruitbodies showed ß-glucan levels at 14.5%.
A protein-bound polysaccharide (D-fraction) is particularly effective via oral administration. How these polysaccharides activate the mammalian immune system is still being studied. However, an increase in helper “T” cells has been seen with some AIDS patients. With other AIDS patients, the decline in helper “T” cells is interrupted. Much more research will be published in the next few years.
Other medicinal claims for this mushroom include reduction of blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and a wide variety of cancers.
