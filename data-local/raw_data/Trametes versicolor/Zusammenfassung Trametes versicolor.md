TRAMETES VERSICOLOR (VAR. POLYPORUS VERSICOLOR, POLYSTICTUS VERSICOLOR VAR. NIGRICANS)
The almond mushroom was discovered in the rainforests of Brazil about 30 years ago. Cancer was completely unknown to the local population who regularly consumed this mushroom.

**Identification:**
Smell (Spawn): Grain spawn sweet, pleasant, and distinctly “polypore-esque.”
Smell (Fruit): **Pilzlich angenehm.**
Taste: **Pilzlich unangenehm, mild.**
Cap: offset of indistinct
Fruit Body: A classic bracket fungus, with multicolored, closely concentric zonations on fan-like shelves, often forming rosettes of overlapping fruitbodies, with slightly hairy surfaces and usually with a wavy outer margin. Mushrooms are highly variable in color, rich with earth tones of grays and browns, often with bluish, greenish, reddish, or whitish zones.
Hymenium: decurrent, Underside covered with whitish pores. **3-6 pro mm, und bis 1,5 mm tief, rundlich-eckig, weißlich, später gelblich, alt auch braun oder graubraun, eckig, später gelblich, sehr variabel.**
Stipe: Stem absent or if present, central and short.
Flesh:
|  | Wie fast alle Trameten - weißlich, dünn. Zwischen Hutfilz (Huthaut) und Fleisch ist meist eine dunkle Schicht, die sogenannte Cortexschicht. Dieses ist das Hauptmerkmal zur Unterscheidung bei Schmetterlingstrameten, da diese sehr farblich variabel im Aussehen zu anderen Trameten sein kann. Jedoch kann diese Schicht ausnahmsweise auch fehlen und es sind dennoch Schmetterlingstrameten. Anwachsstelle dünn, im Gegensatz zur Ockertramete, dort ist die Anwachsstelle dick! |

Veil: none
Spores/microscopic features: Spores 5–6 × 1.5–2 µ, cyclindric, smooth, slightly curved, whitish in deposit. Hyphal system trimitic. Heterothallic mating strategy.
Growing Characteristic: Although an annual mushroom, often surviving for several seasons, the fruitbodies become a dull grayish long after the life cycle has completed. Often forming great colonies, especially on downed hardwood logs and stumps.
Natural habitat: Turkey Tail is the most common polypore on dead hardwoods, more rarely on conifers. Most Shiitake cultivators have encountered this fungus as it is a common competitor on natural logs. **Laubholz, Buche, Eiche, Birke, Pappel, Folgezersetzer, Weißfäuleauslöser, ganzjährig (einjährig).**
Danger of confusion: TRAMETES OCHRACEA, TRAMETES GIBBOSA, TRAMETES HIRSUTA, STEREUM HIRSUTUM, STEREUM SUBTOMENTOSUM, TRAMETES OCHRACEA, TRICHAPTUM BIFORME, CERIOPORUS STEREOIDES, TRAMETOPSIS CERVINA, METULOIDEA FRAGRANS
Mycelial Characteristic: Producing a whitish, tenacious, sheet-like, leathery mycelium, soon toughening in age, becoming aerial and exuding a yellowish metabolite. If the culture ages more than 2 weeks, the sharpest of scalpels only succeeds in tearing off skin-like sheaths of mycelium from the agar surface.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: MYPA, PDYA, OMYA, and/or DFA.

Cropping Cycle: two to three flushes over three months
Substrates: This aggressive mushroom can decompose most hardwoods. I recommend oak, tan oak, alder, poplar, aspen, elm, ironwood, and eucalyptus. This is one of the few mushrooms that grow well on apple, cherry, and other fruit trees. Note that the softer hardwoods are quickly consumed by this species, leading to early, if not briefer flushes. The denser woods allow for fruitings over a longer period.
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Plastic bags, bottles, and trays. This mushroom fruits equally well on horizontal and vertical surfaces.
Biological efficiencies: A mushroom with much less moisture content than most (75–80%), a 4.5-pound (2-kg) block of sawdust yields 100–200 grams of mushrooms (dry).

Medicinical Properties:
Trametes versicolor is the source of PSK, commercially known as “Krestin,” responsible for several hundred million dollars of sales as an approved anticancer drug in Asia. In clinical studies of 224 patients (Sugimachi et al. 1997) and 262 patients (Nakazato et al. 1994) afflicted with gastric cancer and treated with chemotherapy, patients showed a decrease in recurrence and an increase in the disease-free survival rate when treatment was combined with a regimen of using the protein-bound polysaccharide (PSK) from Trametes versicolor. By all measures, the treatment was clearly cost-effective. PSK reduces cancer metastasis (Kobayashi et al. 1995). PSK stimulated interleukin-1 production in human cells (Sakagami et al. 1993). PSK was also found to be a scavenger of free-radical oxidizing compounds (superoxide anions) through the production of manganese superoxide dismutases (Kobayashi et al. 1993; Kim et al. 1999). A highly water-soluble, low-cytotoxic polysaccharopeptide (PSP) isolated from this mushroom has been proposed as an antiviral agent inhibiting HIV replication based on an in vitro study (Collins and Ng 1997). PSP is a classic biological response modifier (BRM), inducing gamma interferon, interleukin-2, and T-cell proliferation, differing chemically from PSK in that it has rhamnose and arbinose while PSK does not but has fucose (Ng 1998). Dong et al. (1996, 1997) reported that a polysaccharide peptide (CVP) and its refined form (RPSP) has not only antitumor properties, but elicits an immunomodulating response by inhibiting the proliferation of human leukemia (HL-60) cells while not affecting the growth of normal human peripheral lymphocytes. Yang et al. (1992) also found that a smaller polypeptide (SPCV, 10,000 m.w.) significantly inhibited the growth of leukemia cells. Kariya et al. (1992) and Kobayashi et al. (1994) showed that the protein-bound polysaccharides of Trametes versicolor express superoxide dismutase (antioxidating) mimicking activity. Lin et al. (1996) showed that Coriolus versicolor polysaccharides (CVP) enhanced the recovery of spleen cells subsequent to gamma irradiation. Ghoneum et al. (1995, 1998) conducted two clinical studies in the United States using arabinoxylane, a product from fermenting Trametes versicolor, Lentinula edodes (Shiitake), and Schizophyllum commune, on rice that showed dramatic fivefold increase in NK activity within 2 months of treatment. PSK also has been found to be a strong antibiotic, effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albincans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and other microbes pathogenic to humans (Sakagami and Takeda, 1993; Mayer and Drews, 1980). Both PSK and PSP are present in the mycelium and can be extracted from fermented cultures.
