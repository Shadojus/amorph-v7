Agaricus Blazei Murill, Royal Sun Agaricus, Jisongrong, Himematsutake, Kawariharatake, Cogumelo de Deus (Mushroom of God), Murills Agaricus, ABM, Agaricus subrufescens, A. brasiliensis, King Agaricus, Almond Portobello, Brasilianischer Mandel-Egerling, Sonnenpilz, Lebenspilz
The almond mushroom was discovered in the rainforests of Brazil about 30 years ago. Cancer was completely unknown to the local population who regularly consumed this mushroom.
ABM has the highest concentration of beta-glucans of all medicinal mushrooms in its glycoproteins and regulates the entire immune system. Its ingredients ergosterol and sodium pyroglutamate have a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. They suppress the formation of new blood vessels in cancer cells, which is necessary for the formation of metastases, and induce the death of cancer cells.  
In the United States and Japan, ABM has conducted remarkably successful scientific studies that have shown its effectiveness in the diseases described below. The chemicals have been shown to detoxify and protect the liver in toxic liver disease. ABM promotes blood formation in the bone marrow and supports both blood purification and the defense function of the spleen.

**Identification:**
Smell: almond, mushroom
Taste: sweet, mild, a bit moldy, green nuts
Cap: 7-25cm broad, convex at first, soon hemispheric, then broadly convex, light brown, red to darkbrown, surface covered with brownish fibrillose patches
Hymenium: first pallid, soon gray then chocolate brown, free, close together
Stipe: white-cylindrical, solid, tall, whitish, smoot, flesh thick, often quickly staining yellowish (ochraceous) when bruised, easy to separate from cap
Flesh: white-pink, from edge reddish discoloration
Veil: thin, hanging, quickly ephemeral
Spores/microscopic features: dark violet-(chocolate)brown (5,5-7,5 x 4-5 µm) Spores, Basidia four-spored, heterothallic matting system
Growing Characteristic: singly or in clusters
Natural habitat: Nutrient-rich soil, mixed woods, well compost soils, forest edges, beds, in the greenhouse, subsequent decomposer, warmth-loving, greenhouse, Mediterranean area, America, Asia, early summer to late autumn.
Danger of confusion: AGARICUS SILVATICUS, AGARICUS CAPPELLIANUS, AGARICUS LANGEI, AGARICUS MOELLERI
Mycelial Characteristic: Longitudinally striate mycelium, with radiation rizomorphs overlaying a cottony mycelial undergrowth. Rhizomorphic mycelia in culture produces hyphal aggregates and pseudo-primordia after one month of incubation on 2% MEA, which fail to enlarge to maturity. Becoming loosely aerial in age, mycelia often exude a yellowish, almond-smelling metabolite.

Medicinical Properties: This mushroom produces 1-3 and 1-6 D-fractions of beta glucans, polysaccharides currently under investigation for immunopotentiation. The literature reports beta glucan levels up to 14%. (A recent analysis of the author’s Himematsutake showed 9% beta glucans.) Its unique polysaccharides promote natural killer cells that are selectively cytotoxic on tumor cells. This mushroom has been the subject of numerous analyses for isolating constituents, both tumoricidal and immunomodulatory, for the treatment of cancers (Fujimiya et al. 1998, 1999; Ito et al. 1997; Itoh et al. 1994). The cultured mycelium also produces anti-tumor compounds (Mizuno et al. 1999). That this mushroom produces compounds specifically increasing apoptosis in cancerous cells (but not in healthy cells) and also triggers an immune response, is notable. A yellowish metabolite exuded by the mycelium apparently has bactericidal properties.
A contradition not yet reconciled at the time of this writing is a report by Stijve et al. (2000) that specimens of *A. blazei* from Brazil contained 1,000–3,200 mg/kg (.10–.32%) agaritines. In comparison, another almond flavored Agaricus, *Agaricus augustus*, has up to 2.2% agaritine content (Toth 2000), while Button mushrooms have up to .87%. (See also examples [here](javascript:void\(0\)) and [here](javascript:void\(0\)).)
*Concerns and concerns about cancer such as leukemia, prostate cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, sarcoma. Affected by the healing of skin replacement, elevation regulation, lipid metabolism, immune system stimulation. Treatment of allergies, infections, inflammation. Improvement of the bowel functions.*
