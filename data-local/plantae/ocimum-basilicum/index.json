  "description": "Ocimum basilicum, commonly known as sweet basil or simply basil, is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae, native to tropical regions from Central Africa to Southeast Asia. It is a tender annual plant, best known for its use in Italian cuisine, particularly in pesto and tomato-based dishes. Basil contains eugenol, linalool, and estragole, giving it its characteristic aroma. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for digestive disorders, stress relief, and as an anti-inflammatory agent. Over 60 varieties of basil exist, varying in size, color, and flavor."
