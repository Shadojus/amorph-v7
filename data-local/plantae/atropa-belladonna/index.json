  "description": "Atropa belladonna, commonly known as deadly nightshade or belladonna, is a poisonous perennial herbaceous plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, it is one of the most toxic plants found in the Eastern Hemisphere. The name 'belladonna' (beautiful lady) comes from the historical practice of women using eye drops made from the plant to dilate pupils, which was considered attractive. The plant contains tropane alkaloids including atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. While extremely dangerous, atropine derived from this plant is used in modern medicine as an antidote for nerve agent poisoning and in ophthalmology."
