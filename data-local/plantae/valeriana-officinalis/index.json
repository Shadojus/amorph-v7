  "description": "Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. Its root has been used as a sedative and sleep aid since ancient Greek and Roman times. Hippocrates described its properties, and Galen prescribed it for insomnia. The root contains valerenic acid and isovaleric acid, which have sedative and anxiolytic properties. Valerian is one of the most commonly used herbal supplements for sleep disorders, often combined with hops or lemon balm. Interestingly, while sedating to humans, valerian has a stimulating effect on cats similar to catnip."
