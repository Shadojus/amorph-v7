  "description": "Digitalis purpurea, commonly known as foxglove, is a biennial or short-lived perennial flowering plant native to Western Europe. It produces tall spikes of tubular, purple-pink flowers with spotted throats. Despite its beauty, foxglove is highly toxic and can be fatal if ingested. However, the plant is the source of digoxin and digitoxin, cardiac glycosides used to treat heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure. William Withering introduced digitalis to medicine in 1785. The plant exemplifies the principle that poisons and medicines are often distinguished only by dose."
