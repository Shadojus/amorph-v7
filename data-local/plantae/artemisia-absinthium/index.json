  "description": "Artemisia absinthium, commonly known as wormwood, grand wormwood, or absinthe wormwood, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Eurasia and Northern Africa. It is best known as the key ingredient in absinthe, the notorious green spirit that was banned in many countries in the early 20th century. The plant contains thujone, a compound once blamed for absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic effects, though modern research shows thujone levels in properly distilled absinthe are too low to cause such effects. Wormwood has been used medicinally since ancient times to treat digestive disorders and as an antiparasitic."
