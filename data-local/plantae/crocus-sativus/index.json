  "description": "Crocus sativus, commonly known as saffron crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the iris family Iridaceae. It is cultivated for saffron spice, derived from the dried stigmas of its flowers. Saffron is the world's most expensive spice by weight, requiring approximately 150,000 flowers to produce one kilogram. The plant originated in Greece or Southwest Asia and has been cultivated for over 3500 years. Each flower produces only three stigmas, which must be hand-picked during a narrow harvest window. Saffron contains crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal, which provide its characteristic color, flavor, and aroma."
