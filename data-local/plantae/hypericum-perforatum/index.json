  "description": "Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae native to Europe. It has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. The plant derives its common name from its traditional flowering and harvesting on St. John's Day (June 24). It contains hypericin and hyperforin, which are believed to be responsible for its antidepressant effects. Clinical studies have shown it to be effective for mild to moderate depression, though it has significant drug interactions."
