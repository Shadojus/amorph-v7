  "description": "Chamaemelum nobile, commonly known as Roman chamomile or English chamomile, is a low-growing perennial plant in the family Asteraceae. Native to Western Europe and North Africa, it has been used medicinally for over 2000 years. The ancient Egyptians dedicated it to their sun god Ra. Chamomile contains chamazulene, bisabolol, and apigenin, which provide anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and mild sedative effects. The dried flowers are commonly used to make herbal tea, one of the most popular herbal beverages worldwide, valued for its calming properties."
