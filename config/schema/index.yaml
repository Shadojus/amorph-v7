# AMORPH Schema - Index
# DATA-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE
# Field definitions are derived from data + perspectives, no separate felder.yaml needed

# Schema-Version
version: "3.0"

# === MODULAR STRUCTURE ===
# The schema is split into multiple files:

module:
  # Core system (immutable)
  basis: ./basis.yaml
  
  # Semantic search mappings (customizable)
  semantik: ./semantik.yaml
  
  # Perspectives (dynamically loaded from folder)
  # Each perspective defines its own fields!
  perspektiven: ./perspektiven/

# === DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH ===
# Instead of a separate felder.yaml, field configurations are:
# 1. Defined in perspectives (fields they need)
# 2. Inferred from actual data (types detected automatically)
# 3. Core fields defined in basis.yaml
#
# Benefits:
# - No redundancy between felder.yaml and perspective definitions
# - Perspectives are self-contained and complete
# - System adapts automatically to new fields in data
# - Less configuration, more convention

# === LOAD ORDER ===
# 1. basis.yaml - Core system config
# 2. semantik.yaml - Search mappings
# 3. perspektiven/*.yaml - All perspective files (define their own fields)

# === NOTES ===
# - basis.yaml should not be modified
# - New perspectives: Simply create new .yaml in perspektiven/
# - Perspectives can be activated/deactivated via perspektiven/index.yaml
# - Field types are auto-detected from data and field name patterns
