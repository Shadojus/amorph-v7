**Identification**:
Smell: Musty, farinaceous, not pleasant.
Taste: **Mehlartig, mild.**
Cap: Cap 3–8 cm, hemispheric to convex, and eventually plane. Surface covered with an orangish, glutinous slime, thickly encapsulating the mushroom primordia, thinning as the mushrooms mature. The slime quickly collapses, leaving a viscid cap. Cap surface smooth.
Hymnemium: Gills white to yellow, becoming brown with maturity. Partial veil glutinous/membranous, yellowish, adhering to the upper regions of the stem or along the inside peripheral margin.
Stipe: Stem 5–8 cm long, equal, covered with fibrils and swelled near the base.
Flesh: white
Veil: **Bräunlich, schleimig, schnell vergänglich.**
Spores/microscopic features: Spores cinnamon brown, ellipsoid, small, 4–7 µ × 2.5–3.0 µ, smooth, and lacking a distinct germ pore. Pleurocystidia absent. Clamp connections are present. This mushroom also has a conidial stage that allows the formation of spores directly from the mycelium. Nameko is unique (in contrast to the other species listed in this book) in that a single spore can project a homokaryotic mycelium, and generate mushrooms with homokaryotic spores.
Growing Characteristic:
Natural habitat: On broadleaf hardwood stumps and logs in the temperate forests of Asia, especially deciduous oaks and beech (Fagus crenata).
Danger of confusion: KUEHNEROMYCES MUTABILIS, ARMILLARIA SOLIDIPES
Mycelial Characteristic: Whitish, longitudinally radial, becoming light orangish or tawny from the center as the mycelium ages. On sterilized grain the mycelium is densely cottony white and becomes speckled with yellowish to orangish zones at maturity.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: MEA, MYA, PDYA, and DFA.

Cropping Cycle: two crops in 60 days, 10-14 days apartv
Substrates: The supplemented sawdust formula described in [Chapter 17](javascript:void\(0\)) is recommended. Arita (1969) recommends that no more than 10% rice bran should be used as a supplement for oak hardwood formulations. However, I have found that 20% rice bran supports a more massive first flush and second flush when using Alnus rubra (red alder). Arita also found that the addition of 15% rice bran was the optimum if using conifer sawdust (Pinus densiflora or Asian Pine, and Cryptomeria japonica or Japanese cedar) as the base substrate. This is one of the few gourmet mushrooms that will give rise to substantial fruitings on a conifer wood.
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Autoclavable bottles and polypropylene bags.
Biological efficiencies: The fruitings pictured in this book yielded, on the first flush, an average of slightly more than 1 pound of mushrooms from 5-pound blocks of hardwood sawdust supplemented with rice bran.
**Consuming:**
Nutritional content of 100g:  
Crude protein (N x 4.38): 20.8%; fat: 4.2%; carbohydrate: 66.7%; ash: 8.3%; and fiber: 6.3%. Vitamins (in milligrams per 100 grams dry weight): thiamin 18.8; riboflavin 14.6; niacin 72.9. Minerals (in milligrams per 100 grams dry weight): calcium 42; potassium 2,083; iron 22.9; sodium 63.  
Medicinical Properties: According to Ying (1987), water and sodium hydroxide extracts of this mushroom are 60% and 90% effective, respectively, against Sarcoma 180 implanted in white mice. Furthermore, resistance to infection by Staphylococcus bacteria is substantially improved. This author knows of no parallel studies by Western researchers. The references making these medical claims are in Chinese.
