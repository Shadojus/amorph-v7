LENTINUS EDODES
Shiitake extracts have shown (in vitro) a direct inhibition of the proliferation of human breast cancer cells and immunostimulatory properties with regard to the mitogenic and co-mitogenic activity in vitro.
As nutraceuticals, they activate the body’s own protective system and play an important antioxidant role for the homeostasis of the organism.

**Identification:**
Smell: Grain spawn has a smell similar to crushed fresh Shiitake, sometimes slightly astringent and musty. Sawdust spawn has a sweeter, fresh, and pleasing odor.
Taste: mushroom, lauchartig
Cap: Cap 5–25 cm broad, hemispheric, expanding to convex and eventually plane at maturity. Cap dark brown to nearly black at first, becoming lighter brown in age, or upon drying. Cap margin even to irregular, inrolled at first, then incurved, flattening with maturity and often undulating with age.
Hymenium: Gills white, even at first, becoming serrated or irregular with age[6](javascript:void\(0\)), white, bruising brown when damaged. Stem fibrous, centrally to eccentrically attached, fibrous, and tough in texture. **Weißlich-cremefarben, später dunkler gelb-braun, frei bis fein angewachsen, gegabelt, leicht ablösbar, mit Zwischenlamellen.**
Stipe: **Bräunlich faserig auf hellem Grund, kurz, mit wolliger Ringzone,**
Flesh: Flesh bruises brownish.

Veil:
Spores/microscopic features: Spores white 5–6.5 (7) × 3–3.5 µ, ovoid to oblong ellipsoid. Basidia four-spored. Hyphal system monomitic. Pleurocystidia absent. Clamp connections and cheilocystidia present.
Growing Characteristic:
Natural habitat: This mushroom grows naturally on dead or dying broadleaf trees, particularly the Shii tree (Castanopsis cuspidata), Pasania spp., Quercus spp., and other Asian oaks and beeches. Although occasionally found on dying trees, Shiitake is a true saprophyte exploiting only necrotic tissue.
Danger of confusion: PHOLIOTA POPULNEA, PANUS CONCHATUS
Mycelial Characteristic: Mushroom mycelium white at first, becoming longitudinally linear and cottony-aerial in age, rarely, if ever truly rhizomorphic. In age, or in response to damage, the mycelium becomes dark brown. Some strains develop hyphal aggregates—soft, cottony ball-like structures—that may or may not develop into primordia. Many mycologists classify this species as a white rot fungus for the appearance of the wood after colonization. However, the mycelium of Shiitake is initially white, soon becoming chocolate brown with maturity, leaving a white-pulped wood.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: PDYA, MYA, and OMYA with the addition of .2% of the hardwood sawdust used in the production block.

Cropping Cycle: 2-4 weeks for 8-12 (16) weeks
Substrates: Broadleaf hardwoods such as oak, ironwood, sweetgum, beech, poplar, cottonwood, and alder.
[This formula](javascript:void\(0\)), utilizing sawdust, chips, rice, or rye bran, and buffered with gypsum is ideal for high-yield, indoor production. At makeup this substrate hovers around 5.5 to 6.0. Prior to fruiting, the pH drops to 3.5 to 4.5. (The optimal range for fruiting, according to Chang and Miles, 1989, falls between 4.2 and 4.6.) Other recipes utilize a variety of supplements, including various grains. The cereal brans, most flours, tea leaves, yeast, molasses, etc., are widely used. For further information on formulating sawdust based media, consult Jong (1989), Royse and Bahler (1986), San Antonio (1981), and Ando (1974). The Forest Research Institute of New Zealand published one of the first studies exploring the usefulness of pines (Pinus radiata—the Monterey Pine), which produced satisfactorily yields when combined with a hardwood such as beech or poplar and supplemented with barley grain. (The ratio was 6 parts pine: 3 parts hardwood: 1 part grain.)
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Polypropylene, high-density, thermotolerant polyethylene bags, usually fitted with a microporous filter patch, or stuffed with a cotton plug. Bottle fruitings are impractical. Tray fruitings à la Button mushroom culture have been employed with some success in Europe. However, the advantage of bag culture is that contaminants can be isolated, limiting cross-contamination of adjoining substrates.
Biological efficiencies: 1.5–3 pounds of fresh mushrooms from 6 pounds of sawdust/chip/bran. Biological efficiency rating of 100–200% using the methods described herein.
**Consuming:**
Nutritional content of 100g:  
Protein 13–18%; niacin (mg/100 g): 55; thiamin (mg/100 g): 7.8; riboflavin (mg/100 g): 5.0. Ash: 3.5–6.5%. Fiber: 6–15%. Fat: 2–5%. Vetter (1995) found that the caps had 15.24% protein while stems had 11%.  
Medicinical Properties:
Lentinan, a water-soluble polysaccharide (ß-1,3 glucan with ß-1,6 and ß-1,3 glucopyranoside branchings) extracted from the mushrooms, is approved as an anticancer drug in Japan. The Japanese researcher Chihara was one of the first to publish on the anticancer properties of Shiitake, stating that lentinan “was found to almost completely regress the solid type tumors of Sarcoma 180 and several kinds of tumors including methylchloranthrene-induced fibrosarcoma in synergic host-tumour system” (Chihara, 1978, p. 809). The mode of activity appears to be the activation of killer and helper “T” cells.
Another heavyweight polysaccharide, called KS-2, isolated by Fujii et al. (1978), also suppressed Sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich ascotes carcinoma in mice. Other protein-bound fractions have shown differing degrees of antitumor activity. Clearly, a number of anti-tumor compounds are produced in Shiitake besides the well-known lentinan.
In the past twenty years, more than a hundred research papers have been published on the chemical constituents of Shiitake and their health stimulating properties. In an early study (Sarkar, 1993), an extract from the cultured mycelium of Shiitake interrupted the replication of the type 1, herpes simplex virus. Ghoneum (1998) has shown that an arabinoxylane derivative from fermenting Shiitake is effective in slowing the HIV virus. In clinical trials at the San Francisco General Hospital, Gordon (1998) found that a combination of lentinan with didanosine (ddI) showed a mean increase of 142 CD-4 cells/mm3 over a 12-month period compared to a decrease in CD4 cells in patients treated with ddI alone. Odani et al. (1999) has isolated a novel serine proteinase inhibitor from the fruitbodies with a molecular mass of 15,999. In a study on the effect of a novel low molecular polysaccharide fraction on human cells, interleukin1 and apoptosis on human neutrophils decreased while increasing interleukin 1 and apoptosis in the monocytic (U937) human leukemia cells. (Sia et al., 1999). Yamamoto et al. (1997) found that Shiitake’s mycelium produces a water soluble lignin-polysaccharide fraction, unique from lentinan, which has potent anti-viral and immunopotentiating activities in vitro and in vivo. These studies confirm the medical significance of this species, and encourage further research.
In a series of clinical studies by Ghoneum et al (1994, 1995, 1996), patients afflicted with a variety of cancers, some with advanced malignancies, were treated with mycelially derived hemicellulose compounds and showed significant improvement. Ghoneum (1998) found that arabinoxylane, a fraction from the fermentation of Shiitake, Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor), and the split gill mushroom (Schizophyllum commune), increased human NK activity by a factor of 5 in 2 months. Ghoneum’s studies are the first clinical trials with cancer and mushrooms in the United States. Shiitake has also shown promise in lowering blood pressure. (Kabir and Yamaguchi, 1987; Jong et al., 1991.) Novel antibiotics have recently been isolated from Shiitake. (Hirasawa, 1999). The cholesterol-lowing compound was identified as eritadenine, an adenine derivative.
A very small percentage of individuals are allergic to Shiitake mushrooms, and a rare form of dermatitis, exacerbated by sunlight, has been reported in Japan (Hanada et al. 1998).
