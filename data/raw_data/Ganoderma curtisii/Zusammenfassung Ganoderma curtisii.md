**Ganoderma curtisii**
*Polyporus curtisii* Berk. (1849)  
*Fomes curtisii* (Berk.) [Cooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Cubitt_Cooke) (1885)  
*Scindalma curtisii* (Berk.) [Kuntze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Kuntze) (1898)

Ganoderma curtisii posseses the same medicinal properties as Ganoderma lucidum.
Lingzhi (Ganoderma lucidum) is a wood mushroom highly prized in traditional medicine and is widely consumed because it is believed to promote health and longevity, reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, and strengthen the immune system.
It produces polysaccharides and oxygenated triterpenoids with a very broad spectrum of biological activities and pharmacological functions.

Cap: offset
Hymenium: decurrent or subdecurrent, pores, The pores bruise brown when damaged.
Stipe: bare, This polypore bears a marked resemblance to *G. lucidum* and generally has a [stipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_\(mycology\)), sometimes lacking the characteristic red to purple varnished appearance that *G. lucidum* possesses.
Flesh: The [flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trama_\(mycology\)) is spongy in pore tissue and firm in the stipe.
Veil:
Spores/microscopic features: brown
Growing Characteristic:
Natural habitat: Its habitat of choice is decaying stumps and roots of [hardwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwoods), which aligns perfectly with that of [*G. sessile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_sessile).
