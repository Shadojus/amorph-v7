PLEUROTUS PULMONARIUS (SYN. AGARICUS PULMONARIUS, PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS VAR. PULMONARIUS, PLEUROTUS PULMONARIUS VAR. LAPPONICUS,
PLEUROTUS PULMONARIUS VAR. JUGLANDIS, PLEUROTUS ARAUCARIICOLA + Zuchtform PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS Sommerausternseitling)
The Indian Oyster  
 The Phoenix Mushroom  
 Dhingri (in northern India)  
 “Pleurotus sajor-caju” (misapplied by cultivators)
The polysaccharide obtained from P. pulmonius was structurally characterized and tested for antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.The polysaccharide was effective against almost all the pathogens tested.
The percentage of sperm motility was higher in polysaccharide-treated rats while it was lower in diclofenac-treated rats. The sperm count increased significantly in rats treated with polysaccharide.
The significant increase in some blood parameters proofs the anti-inflammatory potential of the polysaccharide.

**Identification:**
Smell: Grain spawn sweet, pleasant, and distinctly “Oyster-esque.”
Taste: **Mild, roh blutzersetzend (enthält Hämolysine).**
Cap: offset and convex, Cap convex at first, expanding to broadly convex, eventually flat or upturned and often wavy in age; 5–20+ cm in diameter. Grayish white to beige to lilac gray to gray-brown, sometimes with pinkish or orangish tones. (At high temperatures, the cap is lighter in color. Under the same light conditions, under cold conditions, the cap becomes very dark gray to gray black.) Cap margin smooth to undulating like an Oyster. Color varies according to the strain, lighting, and temperature conditions.
hymenium: gills, decurrent, **Weißlich bis cremefarben, alt gilbend, oft nur am Rand, untermischt, gedrängt, Schneiden glatt, am Stiel meist eher kurz herablaufend und selten mit aderigen Querverbindungen.**
stipe: bare, Stems are typically eccentrically attached to the cap.
Flesh: Flesh generally thin.
Veil: none
Spores/microscopic features: Spores white to yellowish to lavender gray when dense, more or less cylindrical, 7.5–11 × 3–4 µ. Clamp connections present. Hyphal system monomitic.
Growing Characteristic: Strains of this mushroom rarely form clusters of more than 5 or 6 mushrooms. **Im Gegensatz zum** [**Austernseitling**](https://www.123pilzsuche.de/daten/details/Austernseitling1105.htm) **benötigt der Lungenseitling keinen Kältereiz um Fruchtkörper zu bilden. Die deutsche Bezeichnung Sommer-Austernseitling wird auch für andere Seitlings-Arten wie die Zuchtform des** [**Austernseitlings**](https://www.123pilzsuche.de/daten/details/Austernseitling1105.htm) **(PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS) gerne verwendet.**
Natural habitat: In the eastern United States, this mushroom primarily decomposes hardwoods, while in the western regions, the species can be found at middle elevations (1,200-3,000 meters) on conifers (Abies and Picea). Common in the spring and summer.
Danger of confusion: PLEUROTUS DJAMOR, PLEUROCYBELLA PORRIGENS, PLEUROTUS CORNUCOPIAE, PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS
Mycelial Characteristic: White, linear, becoming cottony, and eventually forming a thick, peelable mycelial mat. If cultures on agar media or on grain are not transferred in a timely fashion (i.e., within 2 weeks), the mycelium becomes so dense as to make inoculations cumbersome and messy. Overincubated cultures cannot be cut, even with the sharpest surgical-grade scalpel, but is torn from the surface of the agar media.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: MYPA, PDYA, OMYA, and/or DFA.

Substrates: Broadly adaptive, producing mushrooms on a great array of organic debris. The substrate materials proven to result in the greatest yields are the cereal (wheat, rice) straws, hardwood sawdusts, cornstalks, sugarcane bagasse, coffee waste (Martinez et al. 1985), pulp mill sludge (Mueller and Gawley 1983), cotton waste, and numerous other agricultural and forest waste by-products. Royse and Bahler (1988) found that the addition of 20% alfalfa hay to wheat straw increased yields substantially. In their studies, yields peaked when a combination of wheat straw, alfalfa, and delayed release nutrients were employed. (The effect of delayed release nutrients on Oyster mushroom yield is discussed in detail by Royse and Schisler, 1987a, 1987b). Alfalfa hay, as any compost maker knows, is considered “hot” because of its elevated nitrogen component. Adding these nitrogenous supplements can boost yields but the cultivator must balance whether or not this advantage is offset by the likely increase in contamination rates. (As a rule, the likelihood of competitor molds increases directly as nitrogen levels are elevated.) For more information, consult Zadrazil (1980).
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Perforated plastic bags, columns, bags, trays, vertical racks, and bottles.
Biological efficiencies: Biological efficiency 100–200%, greatly affected by the size of the fruitbody at the time of harvest and whether or not a fourth or fifth flush is achieved.
**Consuming:**
Nutritional content of 100g:  
Crude protein (N × 4.38): 14–27%; fat: 2%; carbohydrates: 51% (on a dry weight basis). The variation in the reported protein composition of P. pulmonarius and its close relatives is discussed by Rai et al. (1988). For additional information on the nutritional aspects of this mushroom (identified as “P. sajor-caju”), see Bano and Rajarathnam (1982) and El-Kattan et al. (1991). At 25% protein, this mushroom has about half of the protein represented in a hen’s egg, and about one-third of most meats.
