**Ganoderma curtisii**
*Polyporus curtisii* Berk. (1849)  
*Fomes curtisii* (Berk.) [Cooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Cubitt_Cooke) (1885)  
*Scindalma curtisii* (Berk.) [Kuntze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Kuntze) (1898)
Red reishi
Ganoderma fruit bodies and mycelium contain polysaccharides that inhibit tumor growth. Identified as glucans, one of the main constituents of the fungal cell wall, they appear to increase physical resistance to tumor growth, induce interferon production, improve immune function, and destroy tumor cells in the body.
The role of medicinal mushrooms in metabolic regulation is gaining increasing attention. Its use in the development and application of beneficial biological activities has the advantage that the active ingredient is safe and acceptable to humans.

**Identification:**
Smell:
Taste:
Cap: offset
Hymenium: decurrent or subdecurrent, pores, The pores bruise brown when damaged.
Stipe: bare, This polypore bears a marked resemblance to *G. lucidum* and generally has a [stipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_\(mycology\)), sometimes lacking the characteristic red to purple varnished appearance that *G. lucidum* possesses.
Flesh: The [flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trama_\(mycology\)) is spongy in pore tissue and firm in the stipe.
Veil:
Spores/microscopic features: brown
Growing Characteristic:
Natural habitat: Its habitat of choice is decaying stumps and roots of [hardwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwoods), which aligns perfectly with that of [*G. sessile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_sessile).
Danger of confusion:
