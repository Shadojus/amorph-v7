AAE shows excellent antioxidant activity, promotes procollagen production, and increases the expression of the HAS-3 gene.  
In Chinese medicine, mushrooms are used in patients with arteriosclerosis to improve blood fluidity and thus treat circulatory disorders. They also have anti-inflammatory effects and lower cholesterol levels.

**Identification:**
Smell: Unpleasant, musty and reminiscent of raw compost
Taste: gelatinous texture, mild, tasteless, jelly
Cap: 2-15 cm broad, ear shaped, generally purplish grayish brown to dingy brown, covered by a medulla of faine hairs. Smooth, wrinkled towards the center and upturned towards the outer edges
Hymenium:
Stipe: sessile
Flesh: gelatinous in texture and readily rehydrating in water to natural form
Veil: -
Spores/microscopic features: white spores in deposit, otherwise hyaline, cylindrical to sausage shaped, 11-14 x 4-6 μm, basidia 4-spored, clamp connections present
Growing Characteristic:
Natural habitat: On conifer or hardwood logs or stumps, especially oaks, willows, locust, mulberry, locust-acacia, and other broadleaf trees. Commonly occurring in soils rich in wood debris, during the cool wet seasons throughout the temperate forests of the world. This mushroom generally favors cool weather and grows from sea level to tree line.
|  | Meist Laubholz, Holunder, Birken oder andere Laubhölzer, parasitär oder/und folgezersetzend, Weißfäuleauslöser, frostbeständig, ganzjährig, meist in der Winter- und Frühlingszeit bei feuchten Witterungsbedingungen. |

Cropping Cycle: every 2 to 3 weeks for three to five flushes
Substrates: Millet, milo, rye, wheat, or sorghum all support the formation of a vigorous and luxuriant mycelial mat. Rye Berries, Supplemented Sawdust,Logs
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Polypropylene bags and bottles. Each should be punctured with ten to twenty holes after full colonization (25 to 40 days after inoculation) to localize primordia formation. One method uses cylindrically shaped polypropylene bags, 6–8 inches in diameter, that are cut open at both ends and laid horizontally to build a wall of exposed surfaces. From these open ends the Wood Ear mushrooms emerge. Others use the type of polypropylene spawn bags fitted with a microporous filter patch. These bags are usually punctured to encourage mushroom formation around the bags, or are partially opened at the top to elicit a surface flush of mushrooms. I personally prefer the puncture hole technique.

Medicinical Properties:
Ying (1987) reports that this mushroom is 80 and 90% effective against Ehrlich carcinoma and Sarcoma 180, respectively. The references are in Chinese. A hematologist at a medical school in Minnesota pricked his finger in a blood-clotting test, and when his blood failed to clot, the ensuing investigation traced the cause to the Wood Ear mushrooms he had eaten the night before at a Chinese Szechwan restaurant. In the United States during 1970s, when Chinese restaurants started serving Wood Ear mushrooms, some patrons noted the emergence of blotchy hemorrhages on their faces the day after consumption. Caucasian women were particularly susceptible. This phenomenon was later dubbed Szechwan Restaurant Syndrome, later becoming known as “Szechwan Purpura” (Hammerschmidt 1980; Benjamin 1995). This discovery lead to a new anticoagulant effective in breaking up blood clots.
Yuan et al. (1998) showed that the water-soluble polysaccharide fraction from Wood Ear had a hypoglycemic effect on genetically diabetic mice. A water-insoluble glucan similar to ß 1-3 D-glucans and ß 1-6 D-glucans (560,000–610,00 m.w.) were isolated from the hot-water extract of the fruiting bodies. In vitro tests showed potent anti-tumor activity against the solid form of Sarcoma 180 (Kio et al. 1991).
Wound pain, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure, inflammation, blood clotting problems, thrombosis, vascular problems, prevention of myocardial infarction, circulatory disorders, regulation of the blood lipid level. Support for problems in the gastrointestinal area, lungs, liver, throat area, cramps, numbness and injuries, regulator for increased vaginal discharge, moisturizes the lungs, has a relaxing effect. A knife tip or half a teaspoon of mushroom powder per day is often enough to have a good effect. Szechwan Purpura Syndrome: Occasionally, an inhibition of platelet aggregation was observed during consumption = agglutination (aggregation) of blood platelets (thrombocytes).
