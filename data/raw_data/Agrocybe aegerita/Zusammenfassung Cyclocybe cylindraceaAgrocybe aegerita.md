**Identification:**
Smell: Mealy, farinaceous, but not pleasant.
Taste: mild
Cap: A substantial mushroom, often up to 12 inches in diameter. Cap convex to hemispheric, expanding to plane at maturity, smooth, yellowish gray to grayish brown to tan to dingy brown, darker towards the center.
Hymenium: Gills gray at first, becoming chocolate brown with spore maturity, dense together, waves, often dotted
Stipe: Stem white, adorned with a well-developed membranous ring, usually colored brown from spore fall.
Flesh: white, darker then nearer the stipe, brownish
Veil:
Spores/microscopic features: Spores smooth, ovoid to slightly ellipsoid, brown, 9–11 × 5–6.5 (7) µ, lacking a distinct germ pore. Clamp connections present.
Growing Characteristic: Growing saprophytically, often in clusters
Natural habitat: on stumps in the southeastern United States and southern Europe. Preferring hardwoods, especially cottonwoods, willows, poplars, maples, box elders, and in China on tea-oil trees. **An Laubholz, vorwiegend an Stümpfen oder Stämmen von Pappeln, Folgezersetzer, +/- auch parasitär, den Baum angreifend, wärmeliebend, gerne Weinanbaugebiete, büschelig, Frühling bis Spätherbst.**
Danger of confusion: AGROCYBE PRAECOX, PLEUROTUS DRYINUS, PLEUROTUS PULMONARIUS
Mycelial Characteristic: Longitudinally linear, becoming cottony, usually not aerial. White at first, soon becoming spotted brown, and eventually tan brown. Primordia usually form on malt extract agar media.
**Growing:**
Agar Culture Media: MYPA, PDYA, OMYA, and DFA.

Cropping cycle: two flushes, 10-14 days apart
Substrates: I have fruited this species on supplemented oak and alder sawdust/chips. Willow, poplar, cottonwood, and maple are just as likely to support substantial fruitings.
Recommended Containers for fruiting: Polypropylene bags and trays. This mushroom is better grown from horizontal surfaces than from vertical ones.
Biological efficiencies: Up to 1 pound of fresh mushrooms per 5–6 pound block of sterilized sawdust/chips/bran. Given the size of fruitings occurring naturally, large-diameter willow, poplar, and cottonwood stumps could sustain massive fruitings for many years.
