**Identification:**

Smell: tasty, mushroom to neutral, Farinaceous and mildly sweet.

Taste: mushroom, mild, sweet

Cap: conical, The shaggy ink cap is easily recognizable from its almost cylindrical cap which initially covers most of its stem. The cap is mostly white with shaggy scales, which are more pale brown at the apex. Cap 4–10 (15) cm high by 3–4 (5) cm thick, vertically oblong, dingy brown at first, soon white, and decorated with ascending scales.

Hymenium: The free gills change rapidly from white to pink, then to black. It is [deliquescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliquescent). Gills crowded, white to pale, long, broad and slightly attached or free to the stem. Stem 6–12 (15) cm long by 1–2 cm thick, equal, hollow, and bulbous at the base, and adorned with a movable, membranous collar-like ring, that separates from the cap margin as the mushrooms enlarge. As the mushrooms mature, the gills blacken, or “deliquesce,” transforming into a black, spore-ladened fluid, which drips from the rapidly receding cap margin.

Stipe: The [stipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_%28mycology%29) has a loose ring and measures 10–40 centimetres (4–16 inches) high by 1–2.5 cm (1⁄2–1 in) diameter.

Flesh: The flesh is white and the taste mild, later reddish, old liquid black

Veil: loose

Spores/microscopic features: Microscopically it lacks pleuro[cystidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystidia). The [spore print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_print) is black-brown and the spores measure 10–13 by 6.5–8 [µm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre), oval, Subhymenium cellular.

Growing Characteristic:

Natural habitat: It grows in groups in places which are often unexpected, such as green areas in towns. It occurs widely in grasslands and meadows in Europe and North America, from June through to November in the UK. It appears to have been introduced to Australia, New Zealand and Iceland. In Australia the species is sufficiently common to have been featured on a [postage stamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp) issued by [Australia Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post) in 1981, In lawns, meadows, around barnyards, in wood chips, along roadsides, and in enriched soils.

Danger of confusion: COPRINOPSIS ALOPECIA, COPRINUS STERQUILINUS, COPRINOPSIS ATRAMENTARIA, COPRINOPSIS STROSSMAYERI, COPRINOPSIS ACUMINATA, COPRINOPSIS PICACEA, COPRINELLUS FLOCCULOSUS

Mycelial Characteristic: Mycelium usually white, cottony, aerial, often develops “tufts” (hyphal aggregates) with maturity. Most strains form mycelial mats asymmetrically shaped along the outer edge.

**Growing:**

Agar Culture Media: PDA, PDYA, MEA, MPYA, DFA, or OMYA.

Cropping Cycle: Two to three flushes, 4-10 days apart

Substrates: Grain (rye, wheat, and sorghum) throughout. The straw/manure compost formulas described by Stamets and Chilton (1983) support substantial fruitings of this mushroom. Another excellent medium can be made from the manure- and urea-enriched sawdust discharged from horse stables. Paper and pulp wastes have also been proven to support fruitings.2 Like most coprophiles, this mushroom greatly benefits from the placement of a peat moss–based casing soil.

Recommended Containers for fruiting: Trays and bags. This mushroom is not inclined to grow from anything but horizontal surfaces.

Biological efficiencies: 80%

Medicinical Properties:

A novel antibiotic has been isolated from this species and is currently being characterized by American researchers. Ying (1987, page 313) reports that the “inhibition rates against Sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich carcinoma are 100% and 90% respectively.” This author knows no other research on the antitumor properties of this mushroom.
