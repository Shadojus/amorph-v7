  "description": "The dyeing poison dart frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) is a species of poison dart frog native to the rainforests of northern South America, including French Guiana, Suriname, Brazil, and Guyana. They display remarkable color polymorphism, with over 100 distinct color morphs ranging from brilliant blue to yellow, with black or white markings. Adults reach 4-5 cm in length. Their skin toxins (pumiliotoxins) are derived from their diet of ants, mites, and other small arthropods. In captivity, they lose toxicity when fed non-toxic prey. Males carry tadpoles on their backs to deposit them in small pools of water in bromeliad leaves."
