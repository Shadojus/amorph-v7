  "description": "The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the largest living terrestrial animal, with bulls reaching up to 6 tonnes. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, these elephants are keystone species that shape their ecosystems by creating clearings, dispersing seeds, and digging waterholes. They possess remarkable intelligence, exhibit complex social behaviors, and demonstrate self-awareness, empathy, and mourning rituals. Their iconic large ears serve as thermoregulatory organs, distinguishing them from the smaller African forest elephant (L. cyclotis)."
