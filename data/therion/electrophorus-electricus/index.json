  "description": "The electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) is a South American knifefish capable of generating powerful electric shocks of up to 860 volts. Despite its name, it is not a true eel but a member of the order Gymnotiformes. Adults can reach 2.5 m in length and 20 kg. Three specialized electric organs (main organ, Hunter's organ, and Sachs' organ) comprise 80% of their body. They use low-voltage pulses for navigation and communication, and high-voltage discharges for stunning prey and defense. Electric eels are obligate air-breathers, surfacing every 10 minutes to gulp air through their highly vascularized mouth."
