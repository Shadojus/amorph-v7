  "description": "The orca (Orcinus orca), also known as the killer whale, is the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae). Found in all oceans from Arctic to Antarctic, orcas are apex predators with diverse diets ranging from fish to marine mammals. They exhibit remarkable social structures called pods, with distinct cultural traditions, dialects, and hunting strategies passed down through generations. Their intelligence, echolocation abilities, and cooperative hunting make them one of the most sophisticated marine predators."
