  "description": "The European mantis (Mantis religiosa) is a praying mantis species native to southern Europe, introduced to North America in 1899. Adults reach 50-75 mm in length, with females larger than males. Their raptorial forelegs are specialized for catching prey, striking in as little as 50-70 milliseconds. They possess stereoscopic vision from their large compound eyes, unique among insects for detecting depth perception. Mantises are the only insects capable of rotating their heads 180 degrees. The species displays sexual cannibalism, with females occasionally consuming males during or after mating. They are voracious predators of insects, spiders, and occasionally small vertebrates."
