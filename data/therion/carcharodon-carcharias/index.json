  "description": "The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is a large mackerel shark found in coastal surface waters of all major oceans. Adults typically reach 4-5 m, with large females occasionally exceeding 6 m and weighing over 2,000 kg. They possess 300 serrated, triangular teeth arranged in multiple rows, with new teeth continuously replacing worn ones. Great whites can detect one drop of blood in 100 liters of water and sense electromagnetic fields generated by prey. They breach the surface at speeds up to 40 km/h when attacking seals. Despite their reputation, unprovoked attacks on humans are rare."
