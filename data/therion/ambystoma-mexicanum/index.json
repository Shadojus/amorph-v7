  "description": "The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a neotenic salamander endemic to Lake Xochimilco near Mexico City. Unlike most amphibians, axolotls retain their larval features throughout life, including external gills, a tail fin, and fully aquatic lifestyle. They possess extraordinary regenerative abilities, capable of regrowing entire limbs, spinal cord tissue, heart, and parts of their brain. Wild axolotls are critically endangered, with populations declining over 90% since 1998 due to habitat loss and invasive species. Adults typically reach 15-45 cm in length. They are extensively used in scientific research due to their regeneration capabilities."
