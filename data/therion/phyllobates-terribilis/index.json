  "description": "The golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) is the most toxic animal on Earth, endemic to the Pacific coast rainforests of Colombia. A single adult contains approximately 1 mg of batrachotoxin, enough to kill 10-20 adult humans or 10,000 mice. Indigenous Embera people use their toxins to poison blowgun darts for hunting. Despite their extreme toxicity, they are only 4-5 cm long. They come in three color morphs: golden yellow (most common), mint green, and orange. Their toxicity is diet-derived from alkaloid-containing prey, primarily beetles and ants. Captive-bred individuals fed non-toxic prey are non-toxic."
