  "description": "The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is the largest living species of lizard, endemic to Indonesian islands including Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. Adults average 2-3 m in length and 70 kg, with large males reaching over 3 m and 90 kg. They are apex predators that hunt deer, pigs, and water buffalo using a combination of venom and septic bacteria. Their saliva contains anticoagulant venom that induces shock and prevents blood clotting. Komodo dragons can detect carrion from 4-9.5 km away using their forked tongue. Females can reproduce through parthenogenesis, producing viable offspring without male fertilization."
