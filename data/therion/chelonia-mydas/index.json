  "description": "The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae, found in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. Named for the green color of their body fat (due to their herbivorous diet), adults primarily feed on seagrasses and algae. They can grow to 1.5 m in length and weigh up to 315 kg. Green sea turtles undertake long migrations between feeding grounds and nesting beaches, with females returning to the same beach where they hatched to lay eggs. They can hold their breath for up to 5 hours during sleep. Once heavily exploited, they are now protected internationally though remain endangered."
