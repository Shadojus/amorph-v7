  "description": "The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats throughout Africa. Adults typically reach 3.5-5 m in length, with exceptional individuals exceeding 6 m. They are apex predators capable of taking prey as large as wildebeest and zebras during river crossings. Nile crocodiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, with eggs incubated at 31-34C producing males and temperatures outside this range producing females. They demonstrate maternal care, carrying hatchlings to water in their mouths and protecting young for up to two years. With a bite force of approximately 22,000 N, they possess one of the strongest bites of any animal."
