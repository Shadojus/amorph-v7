  "description": "The reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus) is a python species native to South and Southeast Asia, holding the record as the world's longest snake. Specimens over 6 m are common, with verified records of individuals exceeding 7 m. They possess heat-sensing pit organs along their upper lip that detect infrared radiation from warm-blooded prey. As ambush predators, they constrict prey including mammals, birds, and occasionally humans. Their distinctive geometric pattern provides camouflage in dappled forest light. Reticulated pythons are excellent swimmers and have colonized many small islands across their range."
