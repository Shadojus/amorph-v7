  "description": "The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is the largest wild member of the Canidae family. Native to Eurasia and North America, wolves are highly social animals that live in family packs led by an alpha pair. They are apex predators specializing in hunting large ungulates like deer, elk, and moose through cooperative pursuit. Wolves communicate through howling, body language, and scent marking. Their ecological role as keystone predators triggers trophic cascades that benefit entire ecosystems. The domestic dog (C. lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf."
