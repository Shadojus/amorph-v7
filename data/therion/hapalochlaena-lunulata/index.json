  "description": "The greater blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata) is a highly venomous cephalopod found in the tropical Pacific Ocean, from northern Australia to the Philippines and Japan. Despite their small size (12-20 cm), they produce tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin with no known antidote. One individual contains enough venom to kill 26 adult humans within minutes. When threatened, their normally camouflaged bodies display vivid, iridescent blue rings as a warning signal. They inhabit reef flats and tide pools, feeding on small crustaceans and fish. Their venom is produced by symbiotic bacteria in their salivary glands."
