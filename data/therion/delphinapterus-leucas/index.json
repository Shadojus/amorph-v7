  "description": "The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) is a small, white toothed whale native to Arctic and sub-Arctic waters. Known as the 'canary of the sea' for their diverse vocalizations, belugas produce clicks, whistles, and chirps for echolocation and communication. Their distinctive white coloration develops around 5-12 years of age, with calves born gray-brown. Unlike most cetaceans, belugas have flexible necks and can turn their heads, and they possess a prominent melon (forehead) used in echolocation. They form large social groups and undertake seasonal migrations following ice patterns."
