  "description": "The common raven (Corvus corax) is a large, all-black passerine bird found across the Northern Hemisphere. They are among the most intelligent of all birds, demonstrating problem-solving abilities, tool use, and even understanding of cause and effect. Ravens can mimic sounds including human speech and produce over 30 distinct vocalizations. They form long-term monogamous pair bonds and engage in complex play behaviors including aerial acrobatics. With a wingspan of 115-150 cm, they are the largest passerine birds. Ravens hold significant roles in mythologies worldwide, from Norse to Indigenous North American cultures."
