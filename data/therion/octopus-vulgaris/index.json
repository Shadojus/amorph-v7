  "description": "The common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) is a mollusk inhabiting temperate and tropical waters worldwide, primarily in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. With a mantle length up to 25 cm and arms spanning 1 m, they possess three hearts, blue blood (copper-based hemocyanin), and the most complex nervous system of any invertebrate. Two-thirds of their neurons are located in their arms. They demonstrate remarkable intelligence, including problem-solving, tool use, and individual recognition. Masters of camouflage, they change color, texture, and pattern in milliseconds using specialized chromatophores. Their short lifespan (1-2 years) limits cultural transmission of learned behaviors."
