  "description": "The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. Native to Asia, tigers are apex predators that primarily hunt ungulates such as deer and wild boar. Recognizable by their distinctive orange coat with black stripes, each tiger has a unique stripe pattern. Once ranging from eastern Turkey to the Sea of Japan, wild tiger populations have declined dramatically due to habitat loss and poaching. Six subspecies survive today: Bengal, Indochinese, Malayan, Siberian, South China, and Sumatran tigers."
