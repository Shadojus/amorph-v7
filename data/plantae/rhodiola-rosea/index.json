  "description": "Rhodiola rosea, commonly known as rhodiola, golden root, or Arctic root, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It grows in cold regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, particularly in mountainous areas and the Arctic. The plant has been used for centuries in traditional medicine in Russia and Scandinavia to increase physical endurance and work productivity. Vikings reportedly used it to enhance physical strength. The root contains rosavins and salidroside, which are believed to be responsible for its adaptogenic properties. Clinical studies suggest benefits for fatigue, depression, and cognitive function under stress."
