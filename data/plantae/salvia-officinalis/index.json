  "description": "Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, common sage, or garden sage, is a perennial evergreen subshrub native to the Mediterranean region. It has been cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes for thousands of years. The name Salvia derives from the Latin 'salvare', meaning 'to save' or 'to heal', reflecting its historical importance in traditional medicine. Sage contains rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, and thujone, and is used to improve memory, reduce inflammation, and treat digestive disorders."
