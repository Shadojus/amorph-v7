  "description": "Thymus vulgaris, commonly known as common thyme or garden thyme, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing aromatic perennial shrub that has been cultivated for over 5000 years. Thyme contains thymol, a natural antiseptic compound used in mouthwashes and disinfectants. The ancient Egyptians used thyme for embalming, while Greeks burned it as incense in temples. Today it remains one of the most important culinary herbs in Mediterranean cuisine."
