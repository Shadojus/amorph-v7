  "description": "Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to south-central Europe and the Mediterranean. The genus name Melissa is Greek for 'honey bee', as the plant is highly attractive to bees. It has been cultivated for over 2000 years for its lemon-scented leaves, which are used in teas, culinary applications, and herbal medicine. Lemon balm contains rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, and is traditionally used for its calming effects, to improve sleep, and to treat cold sores (herpes simplex). It was a key ingredient in Carmelite water, a tonic made by Carmelite nuns since 1611."
