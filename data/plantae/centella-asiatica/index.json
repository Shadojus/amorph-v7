  "description": "Centella asiatica, commonly known as gotu kola, Indian pennywort, or Asiatic pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant in the flowering plant family Apiaceae. Native to tropical and subtropical Asia, it has been used in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. It is often called 'the herb of longevity' in traditional medicine. The plant contains triterpenoids including asiaticoside and madecassoside, which promote wound healing and collagen synthesis. Modern research has focused on its cognitive-enhancing and wound-healing properties. In Sri Lanka, it is believed elephants eat gotu kola for long life."
