  "description": "Matricaria chamomilla (syn. Matricaria recutita), commonly known as German chamomile or wild chamomile, is an annual plant in the family Asteraceae. Native to Europe and Western Asia, it is one of the most ancient medicinal herbs known to mankind. Unlike Roman chamomile which is a perennial, German chamomile is an annual with smaller, more cone-shaped flower heads. The essential oil is blue due to the presence of chamazulene, which forms during steam distillation. German chamomile is the most commercially important chamomile species and is widely used in teas, cosmetics, and herbal preparations."
