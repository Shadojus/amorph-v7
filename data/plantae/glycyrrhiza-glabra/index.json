  "description": "Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice or liquorice, is a herbaceous perennial legume native to Western Asia and Southern Europe. The root has been used as a flavoring agent and medicine for over 4000 years. The name Glycyrrhiza comes from Greek, meaning 'sweet root', as the root is 30-50 times sweeter than sugar due to glycyrrhizin. In traditional Chinese medicine, licorice is used in more formulations than any other herb. However, excessive consumption can cause hypertension and hypokalemia due to glycyrrhizin's effect on cortisol metabolism."
