  "description": "Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, northern Africa, and western North America. The leaves and stems are covered with stinging hairs (trichomes) that inject histamine and formic acid upon contact. Despite its sting, nettle has been used as a food source and medicine for thousands of years. The plant is exceptionally nutritious, containing high levels of iron, calcium, vitamins A and C, and protein. Medicinally, it is used to treat allergies, arthritis, and urinary disorders. The fibers have been used to make cloth since the Bronze Age."
