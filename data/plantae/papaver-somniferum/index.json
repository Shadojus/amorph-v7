  "description": "Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. Native to the eastern Mediterranean, it has been cultivated for at least 5000 years for its medicinal properties. The milky latex (opium) extracted from unripe seed pods contains morphine, codeine, thebaine, and other alkaloids. Morphine remains one of the most effective pain relievers known to medicine and is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines. The seeds (which contain negligible alkaloids) are used in baking. The plant has had profound impacts on history, including the Opium Wars."
