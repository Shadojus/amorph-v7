  "description": "Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, Indian ginseng, or winter cherry, is a plant in the Solanaceae family native to India and Southeast Asia. It has been a cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine for over 3000 years, used as a rasayana (rejuvenating tonic). The name ashwagandha is Sanskrit for 'smell of the horse', referring to both the root's odor and its traditional use to impart strength. The root contains withanolides, which have adaptogenic properties, helping the body cope with stress. Modern clinical trials have shown benefits for anxiety, stress, and cognitive function."
