  "description": "Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae, native to the Mediterranean region. The name derives from the milky-white veins on the leaves. The plant has been used for over 2000 years to treat liver and gallbladder disorders. The seeds contain silymarin, a complex of flavonolignans with hepatoprotective properties. Silymarin is the most commonly used herbal supplement for liver disease worldwide and is included in pharmacopeias in several countries. Clinical studies have shown benefits in cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver damage from toxins."
