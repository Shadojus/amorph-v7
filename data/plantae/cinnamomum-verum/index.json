  "description": "Cinnamomum verum, also called true cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. The inner bark is used to make cinnamon, one of the oldest known spices. It was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs. Ceylon cinnamon is distinguished from cassia cinnamon by its lighter color, more delicate flavor, and lower coumarin content, making it safer for regular consumption. The spice contains cinnamaldehyde, which has antimicrobial and blood sugar-regulating properties."
