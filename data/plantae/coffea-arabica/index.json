  "description": "Coffea arabica, known as Arabica coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Native to the highlands of Ethiopia and South Sudan, it is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated. Arabica accounts for approximately 60-70% of global coffee production and is considered to produce superior quality coffee compared to Coffea canephora (Robusta). The plant requires specific growing conditions including high altitude, consistent rainfall, and temperatures between 15-24 degrees Celsius."
