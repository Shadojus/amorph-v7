  "description": "Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root, is widely used as a spice and in folk medicine. Native to Southeast Asia, ginger was one of the first spices exported from Asia during the spice trade. The rhizome contains gingerols and shogaols, which provide its characteristic pungent flavor and medicinal properties. Ginger has been used for over 5000 years to treat nausea, digestive issues, and inflammation. It is a key ingredient in many Asian cuisines and is consumed fresh, dried, powdered, or as an oil or juice."
