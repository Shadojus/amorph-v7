  "description": "Mentha x piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is a hybrid species of mint, a cross between watermint (Mentha aquatica) and spearmint (Mentha spicata). Native to Europe and the Middle East, peppermint is now cultivated worldwide. It is one of the most economically important aromatic herbs, widely used in food, beverages, cosmetics, and medicine. The essential oil contains menthol, which provides the characteristic cooling sensation and is used to treat digestive disorders, headaches, and respiratory conditions."
