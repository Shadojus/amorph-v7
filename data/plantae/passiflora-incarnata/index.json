  "description": "Passiflora incarnata, commonly known as purple passionflower or maypop, is a fast-growing perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. Spanish missionaries in the 16th century named it 'passion flower' because they saw the complex flower as a symbol of the Passion of Christ. Native American tribes used it as a sedative and to treat wounds. The plant contains flavonoids including chrysin and apigenin, which have anxiolytic and sedative properties. It is approved in Germany as a treatment for nervous restlessness and is commonly combined with valerian and hops in sleep formulations."
