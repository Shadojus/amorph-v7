  "description": "Sambucus nigra, commonly known as elderberry, black elder, or European elder, is a species of flowering plant in the family Adoxaceae, native to most of Europe. The dark purple berries have been used for centuries in traditional European medicine to treat influenza, colds, and respiratory infections. The flowers are used to make elderflower cordial and wine. The plant contains anthocyanins and flavonoids with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. However, raw berries, bark, and leaves contain cyanogenic glycosides and must be cooked before consumption. Elderberry supplements have become popular immune-boosting products."
