  "description": "Camellia sinensis is an evergreen shrub or small tree whose leaves and leaf buds are used to produce tea. Native to East Asia, the plant is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates. All types of true tea (white, green, oolong, black, and pu-erh) come from this single species, with differences arising from processing methods. Tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, and has been cultivated for over 5000 years. The plant contains caffeine, L-theanine, and catechins, which provide stimulant and antioxidant properties."
