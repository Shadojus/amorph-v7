  "description": "Panax ginseng, commonly known as Asian ginseng, Korean ginseng, or Chinese ginseng, is a species of plant whose root has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years. The genus name Panax is derived from the Greek word 'panacea', meaning 'all-healing', reflecting its historical reputation. The root contains ginsenosides, which are believed to be responsible for its adaptogenic properties, helping the body resist stress. Wild ginseng is extremely rare and valuable, with roots selling for thousands of dollars. Cultivation takes 4-6 years before harvest."
