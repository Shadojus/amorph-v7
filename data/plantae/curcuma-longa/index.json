  "description": "Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, is a flowering plant of the ginger family Zingiberaceae, native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The rhizomes are used fresh or boiled, dried, and ground into a deep orange-yellow powder used as a spice and dye. Turmeric has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for nearly 4000 years. It contains curcumin, a polyphenol with powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. India produces nearly all of the world's turmeric and consumes 80% of it."
