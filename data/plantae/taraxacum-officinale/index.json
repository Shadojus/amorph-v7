  "description": "Taraxacum officinale, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the family Asteraceae. Native to Eurasia, it has naturalized worldwide. Though often considered a weed, dandelion is a valuable medicinal and culinary plant. Every part of the plant is edible and nutritious. The leaves are used in salads, the roots can be roasted as a coffee substitute, and the flowers are used to make wine. Medicinally, dandelion is a powerful diuretic (hence the French name pissenlit) and liver tonic. It contains taraxacin, inulin, and high levels of vitamins A, C, and K."
