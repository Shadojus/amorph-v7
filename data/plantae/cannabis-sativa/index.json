  "description": "Cannabis sativa is an annual herbaceous flowering plant indigenous to Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It has been cultivated throughout recorded history for its fiber (hemp), seeds, and medicinal and psychoactive properties. The plant contains over 100 cannabinoids, including THC and CBD, which interact with the human endocannabinoid system. Industrial hemp varieties contain less than 0.3% THC and are cultivated for fiber and seed production, while medicinal and recreational varieties are bred for higher cannabinoid content."
