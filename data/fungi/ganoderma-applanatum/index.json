  "description": "The Artist's Bracket (Ganoderma applanatum), also known as Artist's Conk, is a perennial bracket fungus with a characteristically flat, shelf-like shape. Its name derives from the property of the white pore surface, which permanently stains brown when touched - allowing pictures to be drawn on it. The fungus causes white rot in hardwoods. In Traditional Chinese Medicine it is used as a medicinal mushroom."
