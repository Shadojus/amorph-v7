  "description": "The Maitake (Grifola frondosa), also called Hen of the Woods or Dancing Mushroom, is a large, prized edible and medicinal mushroom. It can weigh over 20 kg and consists of many overlapping, gray-brown caps on a common stem. It grows at the root area of oaks and chestnuts. In Japan it is considered an important medicinal mushroom with immunostimulating and antitumoral properties through the compound grifolan (beta-glucan D-fraction)."
