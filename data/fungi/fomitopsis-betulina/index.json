  "description": "The Birch Polypore (Fomitopsis betulina) is a well-known medicinal mushroom that grows exclusively on birch trees. Historically significant is the find with the Iceman (Oetzi), who carried two pieces of this fungus with him. In folk medicine it has been used for millennia against gastrointestinal complaints, for wound healing and as an anti-inflammatory. Modern studies confirm antibacterial, antiviral and antitumoral properties."
