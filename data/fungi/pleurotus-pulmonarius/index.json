  "description": "The Phoenix Oyster (Pleurotus pulmonarius), also called Indian Oyster or Summer Oyster, is a widely distributed edible and cultivated mushroom. Unlike the oyster mushroom, it does not require a cold shock for fruiting body formation. It contains hemolysins (like all Pleurotus species) which are destroyed during cooking. Its polysaccharides show antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties."
