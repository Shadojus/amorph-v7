  "description": "The Morel (Morchella esculenta) is a prized spring mushroom from the family Morchellaceae. The characteristic honeycomb-like cap with deep chambers and the hollow stem make it unmistakable. It grows from March to May in riparian forests, parks and on calcareous soils, often in association with ash trees. Morels must never be eaten raw as they contain the heat-sensitive toxin gyromitrin. Properly prepared, they are among the most culinarily valuable mushrooms with an intense, nutty-spicy aroma."
