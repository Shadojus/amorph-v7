  "description": "The Almond Mushroom (Agaricus subrufescens), also known as Agaricus blazei, Himematsutake or Cogumelo de Deus, is an edible mushroom with an intense almond aroma. Originally discovered in the rainforests of Brazil, it is today one of the most important medicinal mushrooms worldwide. It possesses the highest concentration of beta-glucans of all medicinal mushrooms and is intensively studied for its immunomodulatory and antitumoral properties. Remarkably successful studies on its healing effects have been conducted in Japan and the USA."
