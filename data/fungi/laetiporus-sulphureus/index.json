  "description": "The Chicken of the Woods (Laetiporus sulphureus), also called Sulphur Shelf, is a striking, sulfur-yellow to orange colored bracket fungus. It grows mainly on hardwoods and is an aggressive wood decomposer causing brown rot. When young it is a good edible mushroom with chicken-like taste, but becomes tough with age. It is indigestible raw due to oxalic acid."
