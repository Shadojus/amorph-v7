  "description": "The Wine Cap (Stropharia rugosoannulata), also called King Stropharia or Garden Giant, is an excellent edible mushroom from the family Strophariaceae. With caps of 4-13 cm diameter and reddish-brown coloring, it is one of the largest Stropharia species. It is successfully cultivated on straw and wood chips and is excellent for garden cultivation. Ecologically interesting is its ability for soil remediation - it can absorb pollutants such as heavy metals and organic compounds from the soil."
