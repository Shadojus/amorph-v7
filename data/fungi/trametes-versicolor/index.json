The fan to rosette-shaped fruiting body shows characteristic concentric color zones in gray, brown, blue and green tones. As a white rot fungus, it decomposes dead wood of deciduous trees. It is the source of PSK (Krestin) and PSP, which are used as approved cancer medicines in Asia and stimulate the immune system."
