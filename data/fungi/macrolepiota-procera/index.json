  "description": "The Parasol Mushroom (Macrolepiota procera) is one of the most popular and largest edible mushrooms in Europe. With cap diameters up to 30 cm and stems up to 40 cm, it presents an impressive sight in forest clearings and heathlands. Its nutty taste and characteristic snakeskin-patterned stem surface make it unmistakable. Important: The ring must be movable to rule out confusion with poisonous parasol look-alikes."
