  "description": "The Bitter Oyster (Panellus stipticus) is a small, shell-shaped fungus that grows on hardwood. It is particularly notable for its bioluminescence - the mycelium and young fruiting bodies glow greenish in the dark. The fungus is inedible due to its bitter-pungent taste. The bioluminescence is based on the substances PS-A and PS-B (luciferin precursors)."
